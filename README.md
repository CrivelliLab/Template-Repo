# Template Repo

This repo serves as a template for research project conducted by student interns.
The general structure of the repo is inspired by the paper,
[Good enough practices in scientific computing](pcbi.1005510.pdf). We recommend
you read through the paper as it provides good information about conducting
computational research. This repo also serves as a guide of working with NERSC's
computing resources at the lab, where to store your project material, and expectations
about documentation to ensure that we promote reproducibility of research!
